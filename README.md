# Notion to Obsidian (WIP)

The goal of this project is to create an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault from [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) pages.

Generated markdown files contain the content from Notion and a link to the corresponding Notion page.

I hope Notion will implement a Obsidian-like graph view in the future.

## Roadmap

- [x] Create a vault from Notion pages
- [x] Organize files in folders
- [x] Actually copy content from Notion to Obsidian (notion-obsidian-sync)
  - Make searching easier
  - Use the true power of Obsidian
- [x] Cache pages to avoid downloading them if they haven't changed
- [x] Represent titles hierarchy in graph
- [ ] Represent external links in graph
- [ ] Add a CLI (ideally an Obsidian plugin)
