# Notion to Obsidian (WIP)

The goal of this project is to create an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault from [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) pages.

**It is for vizualisation purpose only**, generated markdown files only contain a link to the corresponding Notion page, their content is not copied.

I hope Notion will implement a Obsidian-like graph view in the future.
